# Reuse-the-cards-in-Xamarin.Forms-SfCardView

This section explains how to reuse a dismissed card in SfCardView. This allows reusing a single card for showing different content with every swipe. This will optimize the memory usage of your Xamarin application by avoid creating separate card for each content. For more please refer the below KB

[SfCardView](https://help.syncfusion.com/xamarin/cards/getting-started?_ga=2.181927463.1232783100.1593359517-1450022673.1574142796#sfcardview) supports dismissing a card from the view by enabling the [SwipeToDismiss](https://help.syncfusion.com/xamarin/cards/getting-started?_ga=2.181927463.1232783100.1593359517-1450022673.1574142796#swipetodismiss) property. This property also enables reusing the dismissed card to optimize the memory usage of your Xamarin application. Please refer the below code snippet to reuse the dismissed card.

 

To add cards to your project, open the NuGet package manager in Visual Studio, search for [Syncfusion.Xamarin.Cards](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syncfusion.Xamarin.Cards/), and then install it.


**[XAML]**
```
<StackLayout HorizontalOptions="Fill" VerticalOptions="Center">
 
            <!--  CardView with SwipeToDismiss property enabled  -->
            <cards:SfCardView
                SwipeToDismiss="True"
                Dismissed="SfCardView_Dismissed"
                HorizontalOptions="Center"
                VerticalOptions="Center">
 
                <!--  Label to show a content inside card  -->
                <Label
                    BackgroundColor="Red"
                    FontSize="Large"
                    HeightRequest="100"
                    HorizontalOptions="CenterAndExpand"
                    HorizontalTextAlignment="Center"
                    Text="Card View"
                    TextColor="White"
                    VerticalOptions="CenterAndExpand"
                    VerticalTextAlignment="Center"
                    WidthRequest="300" />
 
            </cards:SfCardView>
 
</StackLayout>
```

**[C#]**

```

private int cardNumber;
 
private async void SfCardView_Dismissed(System.Object sender, Syncfusion.XForms.Cards.DismissedEventArgs e)
        {
            await Task.Delay(400);
            SfCardView view = sender as SfCardView;
            (view.Content as Label).Text = "Card View " + cardNumber.ToString();
            view.IsDismissed = false;
            cardNumber++;
        }
```
 
**SwipeToDismiss Property wonâ€™t work when you add the SfCardView as a child of SfCardLayout**
